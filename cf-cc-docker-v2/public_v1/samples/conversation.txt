Hey John, am I glad to see you! I wanted to tell you that my family is in unanimous agreement regarding the IPhone being astonishing. As a matter of fact, it was built under the helm of Steve Jobs, who was a masterful innovator. I bought mine from the Apple Store in New York City. Over the years, I have downloaded a humongous amount of apps from the App Store. I may sound like a broken record about it, but Mary definitely agrees with me. Mary owns an IPad if I'm not mistaken. By the way, if you're jealous, you really should replace your superannuated mobile phone. Well, that's all for now. See you later, alligator!
