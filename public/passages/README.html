Hello: Researchers at IBM would like your help. We are testing a way to make stories easier to read. You don't have to help if you don't want to.
You will read 2 news stories and answer 4 multiple-choice questions about each one. You can stop or take a break at any time. It will take about 20 minutes.
<br><br>
This is not a reading test. You are judging the stories. Some might be difficult to read. It's OK if you cannot answer all the questions.
<br><br>
Your name will not be on your answers, and data from this research will be reported only as a summary. If you have questions at any time, you may contact Will Scott at 512-286-7343 or email scottw1@us.ibm.com.
<br><br>
Thank you very much for your help.
